## Fossil Justifications
Below we give a detailed justification for each accepted fossil regarding the phylogenetic assignment and age bounds.

### **Fossil** 0

**Brief Desription:** The oldest fossil found in Nymphaeales.

**Age Bounds:** 121.4 - 113.0 mya.

**Taxon & Specimen & Rock:** Nymphaeites choffatii, young leaves (specimen 184-Pb. DBAV-UERJ), mature leaves (180a,b-Pb. DBAV-UERJ with an incomplete petiole; 181a,b-183-Pb. DBAV-UERJ), aggregates of roots still showing calyptra (185-190-Pb, DBAV-UERJ), Parnaíba Basin, Codó Formation, Cretaceous to of Brazil.

**Phylogenetic Justification:** This genus *Nymphaeites* was defined to be distinguished with non-peltate leaves with palmate veins branching at acute angles by Heer at 1870. (Bell, 1949) extended the diagnosis of *Nymphaeites* to non-peltate leaves with mixed pinnate and palmate veins as well as peltate and subpeltate leaves with similar venation and a typical petiole, since the secondary vein branches in palmate leaves may suggest a pinnate arrangement. (L. Duarte and R.Silva Santos, 1993) described the leaf remnants found at Parnaíba Basin with common features of symmetrical, orbicular peltate to wide obvate (1.2:1), base symmetrical, rounded to normal obtuse, teeth found along the upper two-thirds of the margin but not along the lateral basal portions, petiole strong and thick, preserved portions about 1.1cm long and 0.6cm width, petiolar insertion at the base of the blade, and specimen-specific features of margin dentate, teeth with a sharp apex, the basal and apical portions straight (182-Pb. DBAV-UERJ) and concave (181-184-Pb. DBAV-UERJ). While the root remnants therein were found to have two distinguished types of arrangement, main roots bearing thin and unbranched secondary roots with preserved calyptras, as well as overlapping aggregates also with preserved calyptras. The representation of leaf and root remnants suggested its assignment to *Nymphaeites choffatii*, according to (L. Duarte and R.Silva Santos, 1993).

**Age Justification:** The sedimentary rock from Parnaíba Basin, Codó Formation was thought to be of Aptian/Albian age (Lima, 1982). Based on numerous findings of the *Nymphaeites* fossil in shales of Aptian age, Duarte and R.Silva Santos suggested the age of the *Nymphaeites* fossil to be within Aptian. Thus, we use 121.4-113.0 mya as the age bound for this fossil, according to the [International Chronostratigraphic Chart v2023/04](www.stratigraphy.org).
