## Fossil Justifications
Below we give a detailed justification for each accepted fossil regarding the phylogenetic assignment and age bounds.

:leaves: **${\text{\color{green} Fossil \ No.0}}$**

**Brief Desription:** The oldest fossil found in Nymphaeales.

**Age Bounds:** 121.4 - 113.0 mya.

**Taxon & Specimen & Rock:** *Nymphaeites choffatii*, young leaves (specimen 184-Pb. DBAV-UERJ), mature leaves (180a,b-Pb. DBAV-UERJ with an incomplete petiole; 181a,b-183-Pb. DBAV-UERJ), aggregates of roots still showing calyptra (185-190-Pb, DBAV-UERJ), Parnaíba Basin, Codó Formation, Cretaceous to of Brazil.

**Phylogenetic Justification:** This genus *Nymphaeites* was defined to be distinguished with non-peltate leaves with palmate veins branching at acute angles by Heer at 1870. (Bell, 1949) extended the diagnosis of *Nymphaeites* to non-peltate leaves with mixed pinnate and palmate veins as well as peltate and subpeltate leaves with similar venation and a typical petiole, since the secondary vein branches in palmate leaves may suggest a pinnate arrangement. (L. Duarte and R.Silva Santos, 1993) described the leaf remnants found at Parnaíba Basin with common features of symmetrical, orbicular peltate to wide obvate (1.2:1), base symmetrical, rounded to normal obtuse, teeth found along the upper two-thirds of the margin but not along the lateral basal portions, petiole strong and thick, preserved portions about 1.1cm long and 0.6cm width, petiolar insertion at the base of the blade, and specimen-specific features of margin dentate, teeth with a sharp apex, the basal and apical portions straight (182-Pb. DBAV-UERJ) and concave (181-184-Pb. DBAV-UERJ). While the root remnants therein were found to have two distinguished types of arrangement, main roots bearing thin and unbranched secondary roots with preserved calyptras, as well as overlapping aggregates also with preserved calyptras. The representation of leaf and root remnants suggested its assignment to *Nymphaeites choffatii*, according to (L. Duarte and R.Silva Santos, 1993).

**Age Justification:** The sedimentary rock from Parnaíba Basin, Codó Formation was thought to be of Aptian/Albian age (Lima, 1982). Based on numerous findings of the *Nymphaeites* fossil in shales of Aptian age, Duarte and R.Silva Santos suggested the age of the *Nymphaeites* fossil to be within Aptian. Thus, we use 121.4-113.0 mya as the age bound for this fossil, according to the [International Chronostratigraphic Chart v2023/04](https://stratigraphy.org/).

:leaves: **${\text{\color{green} Fossil \ No.1}}$**

**Brief Desription:** The oldest fossil found in Austrobaileyales.

**Age Bounds:** 121.4 - 113.0 mya.

**Taxon & Specimen & Rock:** *Cretacaeiporites cf. mulleri*, pollen grains on sample CAS-7, Araripe Basin, Rio da Batateira Formation, Cretaceous of Brazil.

**Phylogenetic Justification:** (Ulrich Heimhofer and Peter-A. Hochuli, 2010) proposed the fossil assignment as *Cretacaeiporites cf. mulleri* based on the observed morphology using Olympus BX 51 microscope.

**Age Justification:** The stratigraphic position of the Rio da Batateira Formation is confined by the occurrences of a number of age-diagnostic gymnosperm pollen taxa including *Afropollis aff. jardinus*, *A. jardinus* and *Sergipea cf. variverrucata* as well as the spore *Crybelosporites pannuceus*. According to (Doyle et al., 1982 and Doyle et al., 1992), the dominance of the heteropolar inaperturate taxon *Afropollis aff. jardinus* and the absence of zonosulcate forms (*A. zonatus* and *A. aff. zonatus*) indicate a late early Aptian (*A. aff. jardinus*) or younger age (*A. jardinus*). In the Rio da Batateira Formation, the maximum abundances of heteropolar *Afropollis* forms reach up to 17% of the whole palynoflora. According to the Northern Gabon reference record of (Doyle et al., 1982), this peak may be part of the second *Afropollis* maximum in palynozone C-X,which covers the uppermost Aptian–Lower Albian interval. (Pons et al., 1996) proposed a late Aptian age for the “Fundão” unit located below the Rio da Batateira Formation. While (Coimbra et al., 2002) also proposed an late Aptian *S. variverrucata* palynozone for the Rio da Batateira formation. Based on the essentially continuous occurrence of *S. variverrucata* in core material covering the Crato, Ipubi and Santana formations, (Regali, 2001) and (Rios-Netto and Regali, 2007) argued in favour of an Aptian age for the entire succession. Desipte the age uncertainty concerning the Santana Formation, a late Aptian age was agreed on the Rio da Batateira formation. Thus, we used 121.4-113.0 mya as the age bound for this fossil, according to the [International Chronostratigraphic Chart v2023/04](https://stratigraphy.org/).
